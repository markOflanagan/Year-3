Lecture Questions 

Question 1:
	In my opinion big data refers to vast amounts of structured, semi-structured and unstructured data 
	that has the potential to be mined for information. This phenomen known as big data can be attributed to the
	rise of the digital age in the early 2000's.

Question 2:

	 Cloud Computing, a model for enabling ubiquitos and on-demand network access to a shared pool of 
	 configureable computing resources. Which vcan be rapidly provisioned and releaesed with minimal 
`	 management.The cloud model is composed of five essential characteristics, three service models,
	 and four deployment models.
	 
	 On-demand self-service: A consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities,
	 such as server time and network storage.

	 Broad network access: Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms 
	 that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms.

	 Resource pooling: The provider's computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, 
	 with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand.

	 Rapid elasticity: Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, in some cases automatically, 
	 to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand.

	 Measured service: Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction 
	 appropriate to the type of service.


Question 3:

IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):
-IaaS is the lowest-level cloud service paradigm and arguably the most important. With IaaS, pre-configured hardware resources are provided to users 
	through a virtual interface.

PaaS (Platform as a Service)
- A cloud service model where the cloud is used to deliver a platform to users from which they can develop, initialize and manage applications. 
	PaaS offerings typically include a base operating system and a suite of applications and development tools.

SaaS (Software as a Service)
- SaaS is a software licensing and delivery model where a fully functional and complete software product is delivered to users over the web on a subscription basis. 
	SaaS offerings are typically accessed by end users through a web browser and can be billed based on consumption or, more simply, with a flat monthly charge.
